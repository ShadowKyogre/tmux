  "body": "# scripting for tmux\r\n\r\ntmux is a great terminal multiplexor.\r\nUnfortunately, it lacks a decent scripting capability.\r\n\r\nThis project fixes tmux and brings it the full power of computer language,\r\nyet preserving consizeness of command line.\r\n\r\ntmux has great support for \"external scripting\" via externally run bash scripts.\r\nThis can be acceptable when there is some real amount of work to be done ocasionally.\r\n\r\nBut what happens if\r\n\r\n  * you want an action on every keypress?\r\n  * you want loops?\r\n  * you want variables?\r\n  * you want something to be done conditionally?\r\n  * you want to do two or more actions in 'mode'? (e.g. scroll by two lines)\r\n\r\nHere is the solution for that.\r\n\r\nWhat it adds to tmux:\r\n\r\n  * Full set of all tmux functions available, regardless in 'mode' or not\r\n  * Full scripting capabilities in 'mode' (e.g. can bind multiple actions, etc)\r\n  * Variables\r\n  * Procedures and functions: don't have to duplicate repeating actions\r\n  * Loops\r\n  * Conditionals\r\n  * In other words, full power of programming language\r\n\r\nFull backwards compatibility: by default, tmux will use it's built-in language.\r\n\r\nThe language attached to tmux has similar syntax: most probably, you will not notice the difference.\r\n\r\n[README](https://github.com/ershov/tmux/blob/master/README-tmux-scripting.pod)\r\n",
